# Database-Design-for-Patient-Assistance-Network-PAN-

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a PAN (Permanent Account Number) Database Management System, designed to manage and query PAN-related data efficiently. The system is built using Azure SQL Database and a Java application that interacts with the database via JDBC. The project encompasses the design of an ER diagram, conversion to a relational schema, selection of appropriate storage structures, and implementation of SQL queries and Java-based functionalities. The project was completed as part of the CS4513 Database Management Systems course, following the requirements outlined in the Individual Project-CS4513 F24 (1).pdf provided by the professor.
